# Q10
```
1) average price of specific brands through years:
 It is interesting to compare the average prices of popular brands through years! as seen in the diagram, apple is always the most expensive product!
```{r ca}
###1) average price of specific brands through years:
# It is interesting to compare the average prices of popular brands through years! as seen in the diagram, apple is always the most expensive product! 
mobile %>% filter(company == "Apple") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(average = mean(price, na.rm = T), company = "Apple") -> Apple_products
mobile %>% filter(company == "Samsung") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(average = mean(price, na.rm = T), company = "Samsung") -> Samsung_products
mobile %>% filter(company == "Nokia") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(average = mean(price, na.rm = T), company = "Nokia") -> Nokia_products
imp = rbind(Apple_products, Samsung_products, Nokia_products)

ggplot(data = imp, aes(x = year, y = average)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = company), stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```
2) Mean of camera pixel vs. display size through years
It's interestig to see how display size and camera pixel correlate each other, and how do they change through years!
```{r car}
###2) Mean of camera pixel vs. display size through years
# It's interestig to see how disolay size and camera pixel correlate each other, and how do they change through years!
mobile %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(cam_p = mean(cam_px, na.rm = T), disp = mean(display_size, na.rm = T)) -> q10_2
ggplot(data = q10_2, aes(x = cam_p, y = disp, color = year)) + geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 3)
```
3) With a budget between 200-300, which mobile is the best to buy for your grandma's birthday?
Well with this budget you have to consider the display size so that your grand ma would be able to work with it perfectly!
So you'll need a list which recommends you the best 20 devices.(arranged by their display size).
```{r a}
###3) With a budget between 200-300, which mobile is the best to buy for your grandma's birthday?
# Well with this budget you have to consider the display size so that your grand ma would be able to work with it perfectly!
# So you'll need a list which recommends you the best 20 devices.(arranged by their display size).
mobile %>% filter(price > 200 & price< 300) %>% arrange(desc(display_size)) -> q10_3
qq = q10_3[1:20, ]
ggplot(data = qq , aes(x = device, y = display_size, label = price, color = "purple")) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(na.rm = T) + geom_label() + coord_flip()
